# Coursify - E-Learning Web Application

Coursify is a full-stack web application designed to manage and deliver online courses. It provides an intuitive user interface for both administrators and users. The app employs the MERN stack, JWT for authentication, and Material UI for styling, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing e-learning experience.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration using JSON Web Token (JWT).
- **Course Management:** Admins can perform CRUD operations on courses, including adding, updating, and deleting courses.
- **Course Catalog:** Users can browse through a comprehensive list of available courses, viewing essential details for each course.
- **Course Purchase:** Users can easily purchase the course to access them later.
- **User Dashboard:** After purchasing a course, users gain access to a personalized dashboard, tracking their enrolled courses.

## Tech Stack
